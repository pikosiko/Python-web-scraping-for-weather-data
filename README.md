# Python-web-scraping-for-weather-data
This program scrapes the web for weather data, presents it in the console and creates a .csv file in the end.

This program uses a get request to get data from a link.
We manipulate the data we take and create a table with days and their period names(DAY- NIGHT), a short description of the weather and a temprature.
The outcome of this program, changes based on the actual website's input for the week.
This program can work with any city in this specific weather website, as long as we change the link in the get request to the city's we want.
Currently it takes data from the LA area.
